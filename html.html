<h2 class='sub-title'>My Background</h2>
  <p>Welcome! My name is Karly Lamm, currently living in the greater Saint Louis area. I believe that education
    and culture are invaluable and precious so I strive to continually broaden my knowledge, stay out of my comfort
    zone, and remain open-minded to new challenges. I love to embrace my passions, and take chances on 
    opportunities I find. Some hobbies that I like to fill my days with include traveling, hiking, snow skiing, 
    photography, learning new programming skills, puzzles, and working with specialty coffee. Some of my favorite destinations I 
    have traveled to would be:</p>

<h2 class='sub-title'>Personal Journey to Software development<h2>
    <p>
       My goal is to become a software engineer. While I could say that I found programming, the truth is 
       that programming found a way to me. In a transitional period for me, programming came in at just the right time.
       While I believe I was meant to work in the tech field, I have not always seen my carear field in it. I attended a 
       Pharmacy school for several years in pursuit of a PharmD; however, nothing about what I was studying or focusing all my time on made me happy. Consuming all of your time on something that is not your passion can be extremley detremental to one's mental state and I ended up dropping out. I was driven by my families desires rather than my own. I felt down that I was a college dropout, and at the right time a coworker told me about LaunchCode and I found a true passion that I plan to create a new carear out of.
       I have always been drawn to the worlds of math, science, and computers. Growing up in a rapidly developing tech world, 
      I have always been fascinated with the idea of creation and electronics. From my toddler ages of 
      attempting to build non-functional robots from soup cans with the imagination that they were programmed, 
      to middle-school days of downloading programs on the home computer to make stick-figure animation games. When 
    I first typed the words "Hello, World" into the console of my application, I knew I was hooked.</p>
